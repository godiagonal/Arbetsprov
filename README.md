# SEARQ - Search songs on iTunes
Simple search app for songs using the iTunes REST API.

### Notes
I wasn't sure if I was allowed to use any third party libraries such as jQuery or Lodash so I just went for plain JavaScript. I've also kept all the scripts in the same file, as per the instructions, which I normally wouldn't do. Ideally the whole app could be built in a component based fashion using a framework such as Vue or Angular.
